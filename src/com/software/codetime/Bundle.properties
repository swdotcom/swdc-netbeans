OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Measure your coding activity in real time\nSoftware shows you your coding activity to help you increase flow, decrease interrupts, and improve work-life balance.\n\n\
    It takes just a minute to install our plugin for NetBeans.\n\n\
    See your coding intensity\nOur plugin for NetBeans features a status bar that shows your keystrokes per minute (KPM) for your last minute of activity. \
    We show a rocket icon if your KPM is equal to or above your average KPM per day for the last 90 days--a subtle reminder of your relative coding focus and intensity.\n\n\
    Time tracking\nLonger sessions are generally more productive because we can maintain context and more easily retain logical constructs related to our code. \
    In the status bar, we show a circle with a partial fill (either 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) to indicate the duration of your current session vs. your average over the last 90 days.\n\n\
    Quantify your coding\nIn addition to KPM and time, we also measure time spent by project, lines of code, characters added/deleted, and your current Spotify or iTunes track. \
    We distill this data into interesting "datagrams" that you can view in your account at app.software.com.\n\n\
    Safe, secure, and free\nAll of our plugins are safe, secure, and free. \
    We do not process, send, or store your proprietary code. \
    We only track productivity-related data, and we make it easy to see the data we collect.
